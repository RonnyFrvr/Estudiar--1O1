    <h2>3. Exam Preparation</h2>
            <p>Prepare effectively for exams with these strategies:
                <dl>
                    <dt>Practice with past papers:</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Obtain past exam papers and practice answering the questions under timed conditions. This helps you become familiar with the exam format and identify areas where you need improvement. Review your answers and seek feedback from teachers or peers.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Active recall:</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Test yourself on the material you need to learn instead of passively reviewing notes. Use flashcards, quizzes, or teach the material to someone else. This technique strengthens memory retention and helps identify gaps in your knowledge.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Healthy habits:</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Ensure you get enough sleep, eat nutritious meals, and stay hydrated. Regular exercise can also help reduce stress and improve concentration. Avoid cramming the night before the exam; instead, review key concepts and get a good night's sleep.
