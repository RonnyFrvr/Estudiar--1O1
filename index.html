            <h2>1. Time Management</h2>
            <p>
                <dt>Create an exam timetable:</dt>
                <dd>Make an exam timetable to properly organize your schedule and increase time management. Include subjects, hours you will study those subjects and ofcourse free time so you wont overdose. Try studying for 25 minutes per  subject with a 5 minute break.</dd>
                <br>
                eg of a suitable exam timetable:
                <br>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Monday</th>

                        <th>Sunday</th>
                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td>Maths - 25min</td>

                    </tr>

                </table>
            </p>

            <h2>2. Note-taking:</h2>
    There are many ways to take notes but in my opinion the best way is to first listen to the teacher for a few seconds then summarize the information given and write it down. And if a teacher continuously repeats a topic it means that 90% of the time it is coming on the exam so pay attention to those.
